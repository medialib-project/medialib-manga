## Use cases

Defining ISO types for mangas, chapters and pages

Defining ISO sources for those mangas (example: [medialib-manga-source-mangadex](https://github.com/medialib-project/medialib-manga-source-mangadex))

Them being ISO means that future manga and manga sources libraries **can be used together** with se same codebase!
